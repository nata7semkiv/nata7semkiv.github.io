	<p>The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. <strong> They are often called house cats</strong> when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.</p>

	<p style="color: green">Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche.</p>
